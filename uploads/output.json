In a dystopian story, society itself is \ntypically the antagonist; it is society that is actively working against the protagonist’s aims and desires. This \noppression frequently is enacted by a totalitarian or authoritarian government, resulting in the loss of civil \nliberties and untenable living conditions, caused by any number of circumstances, such as world overpopulation, \nlaws controlling a person’s sexual or reproductive freedom, and living under constant surveillance. \nWhether or not a society is perceived as a dystopia is usually determined by one’s point of view; what one person \nmay consider to be a horrible dystopia, another may find completely acceptable or even nigh-utopian. For \ninstance, if you don’t care about procreating, then living in a world in which the birth rate is strictly regulated \nwouldn’t seem very dystopic to you; to someone who values that very much, however, having society tell you how, \nwhen (or how often) you can procreate would seem like something out of a nightmare. Or a person who doesn’t \nenjoy reading or intellectual thinking might not care if books are banned... or even hunted down and destroyed, \nas in Fahrenheit 451, whereas you, dear reader, would probably care very much. \nMany societies in fiction are depicted as utopias when in fact they are dystopias; like angels and demons, the two \nare sides of the same coin. This seemingly paradoxical situation can arise because, in a dystopia, the society often \ngives up A in exchange for B, but the benefit of B blinds the society to the loss of A; it is often not until many \nyears later that the loss of A is truly felt, and the citizens come to realize that the world they once thought \nacceptable (or even ideal) is not the world they thought it was. That’s part of what is so compelling—and \ninsidious—about dystopian fiction: the idea that you could be living in a dystopia and not even know it. \nDystopias are often seen as “cautionary tales,” but the best dystopias are not didactic screeds, and the best \ndystopias do not draw their power from whatever political/societal point they might be making; the best \ndystopias speak to the deeper meanings of what it is to be one small part of a teeming civilization... and of what it \nis to be human. \n \nElements of a Dystopia \n Propaganda \n Indoctrination \n God-like ruling figure \n Recreation of history \n Centralized power \n Ideology ahead of humanity \n Paranoia (internal & external enemies) \n Societal organization \n Mass hysteria as a form of control \n "
